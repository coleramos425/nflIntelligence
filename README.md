# nflIntelligence
An analysis of NFL player intelligence and it's link to performance.

## Overview
This is a study conducted in my Economics of Sport class at Santa Clara University. Leveraging my Computer Science background and interest in data science I created a script that collects NFL player data, aggregates statistics, and then cross references player educational background.

I used a number of tools from CSCI 182 (Data Science) and CSCI 183 (Web & Data Crawling) courses including:

  - Pandas
  - Jupiter Notebook
  - Scrapy
  - Scikit-Learn
